# User Personas

## Purpose

The **User Personas** section aims to define and understand the target audiences of the personal portfolio website. By creating detailed representations of these key users, we can ensure that the website’s design, features, and content are tailored to meet their needs, preferences, and goals.

User personas help guide decisions about the website's structure, functionality, and overall user experience. By considering the different types of users—such as potential employers, peers, mentors, and clients—we can create an effective online presence that is both user-friendly and professionally impactful.

Ultimately, this section helps ensure the website serves its primary purpose of showcasing the student's skills and experience while making it easier for the intended audiences to navigate, engage, and take action.

## Persona Types
The personas should include the following types:
- End Users of the Software: The individuals who will use the software in their daily activities.
- Developers of the Software: The team members responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining the software.
- Owner of the Software: The person or entity that owns the rights to the software and oversees its development and distribution.

## Key Characteristics for User Personas

When creating the user personas, the following characteristics should be considered for each persona:

1. **Name and Demographics**:
   - A fictional name to humanize the persona.
   - Age, job title, and education level (if relevant).

2. **Goals**:
   - What does the persona hope to achieve when visiting the website? 
   - What specific information or actions are they seeking (e.g., viewing projects, contacting the student, etc.)?

3. **Behaviors**:
   - How does the persona typically interact with websites or portfolios? 
   - Do they prefer detailed content, or are they more focused on a quick overview?
   - What sections are they most likely to engage with (e.g., project showcases, contact forms, etc.)?

4. **Pain Points**:
   - What challenges or frustrations might the persona experience while navigating the website?
   - Are there specific elements that might discourage engagement (e.g., difficult navigation, lack of project explanations)?

5. **Technological Familiarity**:
   - What is the persona’s level of comfort with technology? 
   - This will influence how simple or advanced the design and features should be.

6. **Motivation**:
   - Why is this persona visiting the website? What is driving their interest in the student's work?

These characteristics will help to create personas that are representative of the real users who will visit the portfolio. Understanding these personas will ensure the design and functionality meet their expectations and needs, creating an optimal experience for each user type.
