Brief Narrative / Scenario
Alex logs into GitHub early in the morning to check the latest pull requests from their fellow developers. They’ve been tasked with implementing the responsive design for the homepage, which includes a hero section, skill set breakdown, and project highlights. After reviewing the design mockups from the designer, Alex starts writing the HTML and CSS for the homepage layout, ensuring that everything looks great across different devices.

Once they finish the initial implementation, Alex tests the page for responsiveness using Chrome DevTools and tweaks the code to address some issues with the mobile layout. They commit their changes to the Git repository, adding notes for the back-end developer who will handle form submissions later. In the afternoon, they attend a team meeting where the group discusses upcoming tasks and design revisions. Alex provides feedback on some user interface elements that might benefit from slight adjustments for better usability.

By the end of the day, Alex pushes the updates, knowing that they’ve made the site one step closer to being a polished, professional portfolio that will impress potential employers.
